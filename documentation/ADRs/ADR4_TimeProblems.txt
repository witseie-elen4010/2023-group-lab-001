CONTEXT:
	The database is stored on a South African server due to Azure restrictions. The local servers used to test the system
	think they are operating in a UTC timezone. The Azure live deployment is hosted on an American server, due to Azure student 
	account restrictions. This creates an issue as the respective servers try to modify the dates and times stored in the database
	to display correctly in their timezones. This is causing date issues as dates on the local servers are showing a day early, and
	on the Azure deployment are showing a day late. This makes it impossible to practically test the system, as well as making the dates on
	the live deployments all be a day late, which is obviously incorrect.

DECISION:
	It is decided to modify all SELECTs in all SQL queries to strip out the time stored (automatically) with the dates in the database. This forces
	the servers hosting the deployments to take the date values as timeless, and as such they cannot try to modify the times to their
	respective timezones and break the true dates.

STATUS:
	Accepted.

CONSEQUENCES:
	All SQL statements reading from the database needed to be modified. All code previously written to address the date
	errors is removed.
	The system now accurately shows the correct dates and times, regardless of what server is hosting the deployment.
	Database is unchanged as date storage is accurate.
