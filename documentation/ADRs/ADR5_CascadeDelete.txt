CONTEXT:
	A lecturer needs to be able to delete an event they have created and make is unavailable to student to book, but
	if a student has already booked a slot with an existing consultation, the database will stop the lecturer from 
	deleting the consultation due to the initial foreign key restriction imposed.

DESCISION:
	It is decided to change the foreign key restriction from 'restricted' to 'cascade' on the eventId foreign key 
	in the bookings table. This allows the lecturer to cascade delete consulations, enabling them to delete a consultation
	which has a slot booked with it.

STATUS:
	Accepted.

CONSEQUENCES:
	A lecturer can now delete a consultation even if a student has booked with it, and the student has no control over it.
	The lecturer is now able to delete consultations they are no longer able to attend.
