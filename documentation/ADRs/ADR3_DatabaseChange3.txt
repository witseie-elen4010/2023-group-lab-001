CONTEXT:
	An admin needs to be able to view a log of all actions taken on the system, and there is currently no table set up in the 
	database which allows the logs to be stored/searched.

DECISION:
	A new table called 'log' is added to the database, as well as a new user role of 'admin'. A new page is added to the website
	which allows the admin to log in and view all system logs.

STATUS:
	Accepted.

CONSEQUENCES:
	All routes needed to be updated to add logging code to them. A new page needed to be added for the admin to see. 
	Login authentication had to be updated. The system now accurately logs all user events and the admin can view them.
