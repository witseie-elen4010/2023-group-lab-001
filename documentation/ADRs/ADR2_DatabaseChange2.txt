CONTEXT:
	The current event object structure where each singular record describes all the possible repeats of an event is 
	causing issues when deleting events - especially if a lecturer wants to delete a single instance of a repeating event.
	
DECISION:
	It is decided to restructure the code which creates events and inserts them into the database to now create an individual 
	record for every possible event, and each event record cannot repeat.

STATUS:
	Accepted.

CONSEQUENCES:
	Code which creates and inserts event records is completely rewritten. Database now stores more records, potentially slowing its
	search times. Events can now accurately be deleted by a lecturer, even if it is a middle instance of a repeat.
